          <p class="f4">I love helping take a great idea from zero to one. In addition to founding Democracy Works and standing up the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life, I’ve advised early-stage organizations and major pivots as a board member, external advisor, and consultant. Those engagements might include:
            <ul><li>Strategy: Honing vision into a clear theory of change, articulating a project’s unique contribution, and doing ecosystem analysis</li>
                <li>Implementation: Drafting budgets, planning staffing or hiring needs, paring a concept back to an effective proof-of-concept or pilot</li>
                <li>Community and facilitation: Social change work has many stakeholders to identify, consult, and engage as part of getting started, whether that’s building advisory groups or mapping potential collaborators and constituents</li>
                <li>Storytelling: Describing new ideas in ways that make them immediately familiar and compelling for funders, partners, and other early-adopter audiences</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="f4">If you’re launching something new and could use a sounding board and helping hand, please <a href="mailto:inquiries@kpete.rs">get in touch</a>!
