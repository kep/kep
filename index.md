            <p>I'm Kathryn Peters (you can also call me Katy).</p>
            <p>I'm a nonprofit entrepreneur: in 2010, I co-founded Democracy Works and served as its Chief Operating Officer for ten years as the organization grew to a staff of 50 and an annual budget of $10m.</p>
            <p>I'm a civic technologist: I designed TurboVote, an election reminder and voter engagment tool, and manage the product through its first million voters served. </p>
            <p>I'm also a manager who values knowing my reports as whole people, a student who loves nothing more than diving into a new subject, and a strategist who puts big ideas into action.</p>
            <p>At present, I'm pursuing a wide range of opportunities, including project work, advisory and board roles, and full-time positions. If you'd like to collaborate, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hi@kpete.rs">hi@kpete.rs</a></p>
