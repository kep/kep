            <p>I'm Kathryn Peters (you can also call me Katy).</p>
            <p>I’m a civic technologist and non-profit entrepreneur. In 2010, I co-founded Democracy Works, and over the next ten years I led the organization’s products, programs, and operations as it grew to a team of 50 and served millions of voters.</p>
            <p>At present, I'm focused on the question of running robust, fair elections during a pandemic. My work includes modeling different resource-planning scenarios for election officials so they can prepare for a variety of circumstances. I'm also strategizing with the civic and political technologists to ensure that voters have the help they need to navigate the process.</p>
            <p>In that work, and more broadly, I'm interested in two overlapping questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How might we create communities that support civic identity? This includes practitioners, who often feel professional loneliness in their roles, and citizens, many of whom understand political life to be an exclusive space?
              </li>
              <li>How can we bring proven community-building practices online or otherwise adapt them to time of physical distancing? In doing so, how can we design for inclusion?
              </li>
            <p>If you’re also asking these questions, want to know more, or would like to collaborate, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hi@kpete.rs">hi@kpete.rs</a></p>
