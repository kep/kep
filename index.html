            <p>I'm Kathryn Peters (you can also call me Katy).</p>
            <p>I’m a civic technologist and non-profit entrepreneur. In 2010, I co-founded <a href="https://democracy.works">Democracy Works</a>, and over the next ten years I led the organization’s products, programs, and operations as it grew to a team of 50 and served millions of voters. In that role, I led the initial development of <a href="https://turbovote.org">TurboVote</a> and <a href="https://howto.vote">How to Vote<a>.</p>
            <p>In 2020, I joined the University of North Carolina's <a href="https://citap.unc.edu">Center for Information, Technology, & Public Life</a> (CITAP) as its inaugural executive director. At CITAP, I support a collaborative, multidisciplinary team of academics working to understand how our civic and digital lives intersect.</p>
            <p>I sit on the board of Democracy Works and the <a href="https://civicdesign.org">Center for Civic Design</a>, and serve as an advisor to <a href="https://vot-er.org/">VotER</a>. When I'm not thinking about democracy or technology, I may be out in the mountains, reading a particularly good novel, befriending yet another dog, or testing a new recipe.</p>
            <p>If you’re also asking these questions, want to know more, or would like to collaborate, you can always find me <a href="https://twitter.com/katyetc">@katyetc</a>.</p>
