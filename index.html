            <p>I'm Kathryn Peters (you can also call me Katy).</p>
            <p>I’m a civic technologist and non-profit entrepreneur. In 2010, I co-founded Democracy Works, and over the next ten years I led the organization’s products, programs, and operations as it grew to a team of 50 and served millions of voters.</p>
            <p>In 2020, I joined the University of North Carolina's <a href="https://citap.unc.edu">Center for Information, Technology, & Pubic Life</a> (CITAP) as its inaugural executive director. At CITAP, I support a collaborative, multidisciplinary team of academics working to understand how our civic and digital lives intersect.</p>
            <p>In my work, I'm interested in how technology serves (and fails) communities and how to design systems (technical and otherwise) that serve real human needs in all their non-binary complexities.</p>
            <p>If you’re also asking these questions, want to know more, or would like to collaborate, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:hi@kpete.rs">hi@kpete.rs</a></p>
