          <p>I'm Kathryn Peters, or Katy, etc.</p>
          <p>I love democracy. Voting? Of course. Participatory budgeting? Now we're talking. Citizens' commissions? Public service design? Social movements? All of it. Building equitable access to power is beautiful, messy work.</p>
          <p>I speak technology. To be honest, I first learned French and HTML around the same time and preferred French&mdash;but HTML opened more opportunities. (I did get to use my French on occasion while working, in IT, for the United Nations.)</p>
          <p>Democracy and technology anchor my professional life. Right now, I'm supporting a brilliant collective of researchers at the <a href="https://citap.unc.edu">Center for Information, Technology, &amp; Public Life</a> (CITAP). I connect research on how we remake inequality in new technologies, what platforms owe democracy, and digital publics with the policymakers, advocates, journalists, and public who shape our civic and public lives online.</p>
          <p>Before CITAP, I co-founded <a href="https://democracy.works">Democracy Works</a> and led operations as it grew to a team of 50 and served millions of voters. You might be one of them&mdash;I designed the initial versions of <a href="https://turbovote.org">TurboVote</a> and <a href="https://howto.vote">How to Vote</a>. I serve on the board of Democracy Works, the <a href="https://civicdesign.org">Center for Civic Design</a>, and <a href="https://vot-er.org/">Vot-ER</a>.</p> 
          <p>When I'm not being civic AF, I'm probably trying to befriend your dog. Skiing, bouldering, and hiking adventures all get me outside and away from screens. I love a good short story: recent favorites include <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735211032">What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky</a>, <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781594485367">Before You Suffocate Your Own Fool Self</a>, and <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101972083">Exhalation</a>. Saturdays are for homemade dumplings and Sundays are for procrastibaking. But really, can I pet your dog?</p>
